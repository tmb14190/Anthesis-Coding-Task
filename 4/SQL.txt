# Built to be used for a MySQL database
# Assuming farm is the database
# This creates a temp database, we do not insert any rows which have duplicates on 
# the combined fields of user, site, customer, and supplier, by using the UNIQUE constraint
# then when adding it to the temp database use INSERT IGNORE to ignore errors caused by duplicates
# then we rename the temporary database to be our new database, and drop the old one

CREATE TABLE temp LIKE farm;
ALTER TABLE temp ADD UNIQUE(user, site, customer, supplier);
INSERT IGNORE INTO temp SELECT * FROM farm;
RENAME TABLE farm TO old_farm, temp TO farm;
DROP TABLE old_farm;
